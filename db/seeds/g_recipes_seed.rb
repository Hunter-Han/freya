  instructions: "1. Cut the pomegranates in half and reserve a few of the seeds for decoration. Squeeze as you would a lemon or an orange, to produce about 500ml juice. Sieve to remove any pips or pith.,;;;
  2. Stir the sugar, lemon juice and grenadine into the pomegranate juice and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the mixture into a plastic freezer container, preferably square or rectangular, with a flat base - a 1-litre capacity clean and dry ice cream container is ideal. Then cover and place in the coldest part of the freezer.,;;;
  3. After about 1-1½ hours, the mixture should have frozen around the edges. Use an electric beater or balloon whist to beat the sorbet until it becomes a uniform slush. Quickly return to the freezer.,;;;
  4. Repeat this process twice, leaving the mixture to partially freeze between each beating. After the final stage, the sorbet will need at least 45 minutes of further freezing before serving. To serve, decorate with reserved pomegranate seeds.",
